 EREINTRO:0 "#T Eastern Roman Empire#!\nDifficulty: #Y Hard#!\n\nAs our game starts, The Roman Empire has been in decline for over 100 years. The western half of the empire is lost to the barbarian successor states while the might of Sassanid Persia looms in the east. A savvy Roman player will need to enact structural reforms so that the empire is well positioned to deal with both internal and external threats."
 PERINTRO:0 "#T Persia#!\nDifficulty: #Y Easy#!\n\nThe Persian Empire dominates Mesopotamia and Iran and is the most formidable opponent of the Roman Empire. Persian players will need to pay attention to all their borders, including the north and south where unexpected enemies might arise."
 OGOINTRO:0 "#T Ostrogoths#!\nDifficulty: #Y Normal#!\n\nThe Ostrogothic Kingdom is the most formidable of the successor states in Western Europe. However, the death of their leader Theodoric has weakened Ostrogothic power, and there are enemies on all sides - including a reinvigorated Rome in the east."
 VGOINTRO:0 "#T Visigoths#!\nDifficulty: #Y Easy#!\n\nThe Visigoths hold a commanding position on the Iberian penninsula. As long as they can maintain the loyalty of their largely Latin subjects they are well-positioned to strike out in multiple directions."
 BURINTRO:0 "#T Burgundians#!\nDifficulty: #Y Hard#!\n\nThe Burgundian Kingdom is sandwiched between formidable kingdoms to the north, south and west. They are in a tricky position, but a savvy Burgundian player has the potential to unite Gaul and create the Holy Roman Empire."
 GUPINTRO:0 "#T Gupta#!\nDifficulty: #Y Easy#!\n\nThe Gupta Empire is the most powerful force in India. While it has been in decline, a savvy Gupta player can turn things around and reestablish their dominant postion on the subcontinent."
