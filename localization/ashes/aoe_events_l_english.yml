 aoe_startup_events.1.t:0 "A New Emperor"
 aoe_startup_events.1.desc:0 "It has been 50 years since the final emperor in the west was overthrown by traitorous barbarians, but the Roman Empire endures. In Constantinople, a new emperor has been crowned. His name is Justinian. He begins his reign facing threats from all sides, but also unique opportunities. \n\nIn the east, a long-lasting peace with Persia is about to end. In the north, migratory hordes threaten the Balkan frontier. Yet while these threats are real, there are also opportunities. The sccessors of Theodoric and Gaiseric are weak. Italy and Africa - two of the richest provinces of the old western empire, are ripe for the taking. \n\nThe empire that endured Hannibal, Mithradites, Shapur and Attila will not just survive - it will thrive!\n\nNOTE: If we take Carthage and Rome in the next 30 years an event will trigger that dissolves the Vandal and Ostrogothic kingdoms."
 aoe_startup_events.1.a:0 "A new world."
 aoe_startup_events.2.t:0 "Persia's Golden Century"
 aoe_startup_events.2.desc:0 "Since Shapur poured molten gold down the throat of the captured emperor Valerian, Sassanid Persia has been the great eastern foe of the Roman Empire.\n\nHowever, since 440 both empires have been occupied by external threats. The Romans lost their western territories while Persia struggled against steppe tribes in the north. With both empires stable, a renewed cycle of war appears to be inevitable.\n\nWith rich lands, a might army and the backing of the Ahura Mazda, Persia will triumph and take its rightful place as the dominant power in Asia."
 aoe_startup_events.2.a:0 "Persia shall triumph."
 aoe_startup_events.3.t:0 "The Frankish Kingdoms"
 aoe_startup_events.3.desc:0 "The Frankish tribes were allies of the Western Roman Empire when it was overrun by barbarians. As Roman power waned in Gaul, the Franks filled the void and became the dominant power in the region. Under Clovis a unified kingdom was created while Chalcedonian Christianity was embraced.\n\nClovis has been dead now for 16 years. His realms were divided among his sons in the traditional Frankish way. Now his sons rule 3 distinct kingdoms based in Paris, Rheims and Soissons.\n\nOnly the strongest, worthiest son will be able to recreate their father's kingdom. When they do they'll rule over a powerful realm capable of dominating western Europe and being both the sword and the shield of Christendom. The Western Roman Empire is dead - long live the new Frankish one!"
 aoe_startup_events.3.a:0 "Long live the king!"
 aoe_startup_events.4.t:0 "The Gothic Kingdoms"
 aoe_startup_events.4.desc:0 "The journey of the goths is a legendary one. The first major blow against the Roman Empire was struck at Adrianople in 378. The Visigoths sacked Rome itself in 410 and built a mighty kingdom in southern Gaul and Hispania. The Ostrogoths led by Theodoric were enlisted by the emperor in Constantinople to liberate Italy from Odoacer - the warlord who deposed the last emperor in the west.\n\nUnder Theodoric, this Visigothic and Ostrogothic kingdoms were in a loose union - creating a quasi Western Roman Empire. However, Theodoric's death just one year ago has significantly reduced Ostrogothic power. Meanwhile the Visigoths have lost ground in Gaul.\n\nWhile the future is uncertain, opportunities abound. The Franks are divided. The Eastern Roman Empire is distracted by the mighty Persian threat. Meanwhile Vandal Africa is rich and ripe for the taking. Perhaps this is truly the century of the Goths."
 aoe_startup_events.4.a:0 "The Goths will triumph!"
 aoe_startup_events.5.t:0 "Thrones of Brittania"
 aoe_startup_events.5.desc:0 "The withdrawal of Roman troops in 410 threw the province of Brittania into chaos. Always somewhat of a backwater, Brittania languished when it was disconnected from Roman trade networks. Invasions by Saxons, Jutes and Angles only made the situation worse.\n\nNow Brittania is divided among squabbling kingdoms. Picts, Romano-British, Britons, Jutes, Angles, Saxons and Irish battle it out to see who will fill the vacuum left by Rome.\n\nWhile these truly are the dark ages, these islands have the potential, under the right leadership, of assuming an important role in the future of Europe."
 aoe_startup_events.5.a:0 "We shall unite these islands!"
 aoe_startup_events.6.t:0 "The Kingdom Of The Vandals"
 aoe_startup_events.6.desc:0 "No barbarian group did more to bring down the Western Roman Empire than the Vandals. Their journey is legendary - starting from Germania they crossed the Rhine, fought their way through Gaul and Hispania, crossed the straights into Mauretania and conquered the richest province of the Western Roman Empire: Africa. Starved of grain and tax revenue, the Western Roman Empire withered up and died.\n\nHowever, the Vandals are in a vulnerable place. Their Arian Christianity is bitterly opposed by their subjects. The Ostrogothic kingdom looms in the north, and rumor has it that Constantinople is looking to retake these rich lands. These will be trying time for the Vandals, and only under the best leadership will they survive.\n\nNOTE: If we lose Carthage within the next 30 years an event will trigger that dissolves our kingdom."
 aoe_startup_events.6.a:0 "We shall beat the Romans again!"
 aoe_startup_events.7.t:0 "The Great Migration"
 aoe_startup_events.7.desc:0 "For hundreds of years, Europe and the Near East have been rocked by great migrations of people. The arrival of the Huns pushed Germanic tribes west, overruning the Western Roman Empire.\n\nNow a second great migration is underway. The two most prominent groups of Slavic and Turkish migrants. These mass movements of people have the potential to transform the world."
 aoe_startup_events.7.a:0 "The world will never be the same again"
 aoe_startup_events.8.t:0 "The Avars"
 aoe_startup_events.8.desc:0 "For hundreds of years, Europe and the Near East have been rocked by great migrations of people. The arrival of the Huns pushed Germanic tribes west, overruning the Western Roman Empire.\n\nNow a second great migration is underway. A group of fierce nomadic warriors - the Avars - have emerged to shake up the balance of power. To their west are slavic tribes, and to their south is the mighty Roman Empire. Will the Avars follow in the footsteps of the Huns and transform the world?"
 aoe_startup_events.8.a:0 "We shall build a mighty khagnate"
 aoe_startup_events.9.t:0 "The Arabs"
 aoe_startup_events.9.desc:0 "Arabia has never been a major player in world affairs. It is divided into many tribes and its hostile climate makes it unappealing to conquerors.\n\nHowever, a great deal of trade flows through the Arab penninsula due to its prime location between India and the Egypt. In addition, the mighty Roman and Persian Empires see the Arabs as useful allies in their never-ending battles for supremecy. With all this wealth coming in, perhaps there will be an opportunity for an ambitious Arab leader to unite these various tribes and make their mark on the world stage..."
 aoe_startup_events.9.a:0 "We shall unite these tribes!"  
 ###ROME EVENTS
 ere_events.1.t:0 "Nika Riots"
 ere_events.1.desc:0 "Chariot races in Constantinople are a big deal, with political factions using them as an opportunity to air out their grievances. At a recent chariot event, supporters of the Blue and Green factions united in protest against the emperor's policies. Riots have broken out, and the city is in shambles."
 ere_events.1.a:0 "Brutally crack down on the rioters"
 ere_events.2.t:0 "Reassert Western Claims"
 ere_events.2.desc:0 "For too long our former western territories have been lost to us. After the devastation of the riots, a successful expedition west could go a long way towards re-establishing our administration's credibility. The rich province of Africa presents the best opportunity."
 ere_events.2.a:0 "It's time to strike"
 ere_events.2.b:0 "We should focus on consolidating our eastern territories."
 ere_events.3.t:0 "The Miaphysite Controversy"
 ere_events.3.desc:0 "Emperors have both secular and religious responsibilities. Currently the church is divided over the nature of Christ - did He have both a human and divine nature, or did He have one divine nature? Miaphysites believe the latter, which is in opposition to official church doctrine. While normally we would stamp out this heresy, Miaphysites happen to be dominant in Egypt and Syria - two of our richest provinces. We must be careful as we resolve this controversy."
 ere_events.3.a:0 "Aggressively convert Miaphysites"  
 ere_events.3.b:0 "Promote tolerance"

 plague_events.3.t:0 "The Plague Returns!"

## Vandal War
 vandal_crisis_events.1.t:0 "Trouble In The Vandal Kingdom"
 vandal_crisis_events.1.desc:0 "Hilderic, king of the Vandals, has angered many of his kin by personally renouncing Arian Christianity. While his tolerant policies are appreciated by most of his subjects, some of the Vandals in his inner circle are not pleased."
 vandal_crisis_events.1.a:0 "We should continue these tolerant policies"
 vandal_crisis_events.1.b:0 "We should give into the pressure and convert back to Arian Christianity"
 vandal_crisis_events.2.t:0 "Hilderic Overthrown"
 vandal_crisis_events.2.desc:0 "Frustrated by the tolerant policies of the Vandal Kingdom, Gelimer has launched a rebellion and taken power in the Vandal Kingdom. A staunch Arian, Gelimer's rise is sure to cause instability - and perhaps draw the attention of Constantinople."
 vandal_crisis_events.2.a:0 "Long Live The King!"
 vandal_crisis_events.3.t:0 "Rebellion In Sardinia"
 vandal_crisis_events.3.desc:0 "Opportunists have taken power in Sardinia, declaring their independence and throwing the kingdom into chaos. We must respond swiftly and brutally to their insolence."
