# I've added several new saints as deities. This should be reflective of the important saints of the era, though there are more that could be added.
# I have several other ideas about ecumenical council events and creating new saints, but it could take some work.
# There is a typo on one of the loading screens. "Charlamagne" should be "Charlemagne". Since this was outside the scope of my task, I left it as is.
# Anatolia should really be Hellenized. Not sure if there was a plan to do this and it's just taking time, but I think it's important if we are going to put in the work to do pops.
